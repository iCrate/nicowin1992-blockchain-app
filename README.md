### Pre-requisite for your Development Setup:

- Python is installed. If not, download and install from the following link https://www.python.org/downloads/
- python-pip Python package manager is installed. If not, run the following command: `apt-get install python-pip`
- boto3 is installed. If not, run the following command: `pip install boto3==1.3.0`. Use python3 and pip3 if you already have python2 configured on your system
- Node Version 8.9.4 (Currently 8.8.1),
- Mongo Version 3.4.13 currently but please use 3.6. UAT has 3.6 unless we are facing issues in testing we will use 3.6.

- DEVELOPMENT IS ALWAYS DONE IN STAGING. Once approved by Daniel, you can promote it to master for deployment into PRODUCTION.
- You should code in your own branch.

### Configure AWS Credential

Open/create file ~/.aws/config , add the following:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
region=ap-southeast-1
```

## How to deploy from dev local machine

### Run command to deploy to AWS

```
npm run publish:stg
npm run publish:prod

first command would deploy to staging environment, second one - into production
```

Whatever inside folder `dist` will be deployed to the indicated environment.

Note: Added automatic deployment when push in staging and master branch

# React Hot Boilerplate

The minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React components.

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ This Is Experimental and Incomplete! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This is **not a good starting point for people learning React.**  
It’s experimental and completely lacks any production features.

**Do not use this as an actual project boilerplate!**  
If you’re just getting started with React, **use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) instead.**

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/nicowin1992/nicowin1992-blockchain-app.git
cd nicowin1992-blockchain-app/
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `src/App.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).

### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.

### WebStorm

Because the WebStorm IDE uses "safe writes" by default, Webpack's file-watcher won't recognize file changes, so hot-loading won't work. To fix this, disable "safe write" in WebStorm.

### Dependencies

- React
- Webpack
- [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
- [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/nicowin1992/nicowin1992-blockchain-app)
